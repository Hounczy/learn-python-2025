**Welcome!**

This repository contains the course material for the Python Crash Course - pt I of [Introduction to Data Science and Programming (IDSP)](https://learnit.itu.dk/course/view.php?id=3024641) at ITU, fall semester 2025.

## Course structure

The Python course consists of 11 units. Each unit consists of a lecture and an exercise. All material for each unit is stored in the folder of the same name (unit01, unit02, and so on). To complete a unit, go first through the lecture (new material, with short in-class hands-on exercises) and then through the corresponding exercise (longer, self-paced practicing of the lecture material).

## Course contents - what you will learn

After completing the course, you will be familiar and comfortable with the following topics:
* Working with Anaconda, Jupyter notebook, and VS Codium
* Python objects (the "building blocks" of Python)
* Fundamental data types: `int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`, further data types and how to work with them: `list`, `set`, `dict`, `tuple`
* Operators (mathematical, assignment, comparison)
* Boolean logic and operations
* Conditional statements (if/else/elif)
* Loops: `for` and `while`
* Writing your own functions
* Interacting with the command line interface (CLI)
* Writing your own Python scripts
* Running Python scripts from the command line interface (CLI)
* Creating interactive Python scripts with user input
* Reading in and processing data in different file formats
* Importing, using, and creating Python modules
* Installing, importing, and using Python packages and libraries 
* Data wrangling with `pandas`
* Package management with `conda`
* Measuring the runtime of your code
* Sending HTTP requests with `requests` and webscraping with `beautifulsoup4`

## Additional resources

In the folder `books`, you will find the PDF versions of 3 books: "Python Crash Course" by Eric Matthes, "Python Projects For Beginners" by Connor Milliken, and "Automate the Boring Stuff" by XX. All three books are great to look up _any_ of the topics from this Python course. Which one will speak most clearly to you is a manner of personal taste, and depending on the topic. Therefore, if you are struggling with a topic or want a more in-depth explanation, make sure to check it out in any or all of the three books!

## Exercise content

Exercise 01 is all about installing the necessary software for this course. From exercise 02 onwards, you will find 2 versions of each exercise notebook: `exerciseXX` and (uploaded later) also `exerciseXX_solved`. Start with `exerciseXX`, and give yourself a couple of hours (and plenty of tries!) to solve the exercises on your own, before you check out the `exerciseXX_solved` notebook.

## How to download the course material

**todo: insert instructions** (Or, if you're familiar with Git, just `git clone` this repository to your local machine, and remember to `git pull` to get the newest version of the repository!)
